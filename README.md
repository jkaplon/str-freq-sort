# str-freq-sort
Small golang project to get frequency counts of characters within a sample string and (hopefully) reveal the secret word.

I chose golang for the project with the hopes of learning more about concurrency with goroutines and channels.
That didn't work out.
Instead, I ended up getting experience with a few new packages and with golang's interfaces.

Also, I got to setup a nice golang development docker container with auto-reload.
